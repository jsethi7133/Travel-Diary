         <p>I believe Amritsar is a city of both sacredness and patriotism.I visited three places over there which are as follows:The Golden temple not only a place of sacredness but also shows the rich heritage of India.The Jallianwala Bagh was a place where hundreds of brave Indians were masscared by British.Wagah Border-the border between India and Pakistan has patriotism in its air.</p>
         
<li><h2>Nainital</h2></li>
